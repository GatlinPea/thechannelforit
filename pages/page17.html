       You try to wake up your friend who seems to not really be taking your exciting adventure very seriously. Peel wakes up with a big yawn and asks you what happened with the color, or thats what he would say if he could talk, he notices the effects of the black switch and tries to comunicate with you through a very poor thought out hand sign language, or maybe its really good and its just that you suck at it, impossible to tell by yourself.<br>
      <p>You decide to get up and bring yourself to the box once again, your friend looks behind you confused as he didnt pay attention to any of your inctedible use of free will, in his silly mind he probably never could have thought about you performing a kick ass backflip. However all of that doesnt matter now, you only got one choice left, might as well finally bring this to an end.</p>
