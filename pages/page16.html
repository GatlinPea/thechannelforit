      it occurs to you that maybe the idea of annoying your friends with such trivial problems as choosing 3 colors to choose from may not be the best use of your time and instead you use your incredible power of free will to choose for yourself which switch to turn off next. <br>
      <P>You decide to go for the red one, no reason in particular really, even though a green switch sounds like the most likely correct option considering whos power box you are messing around with.   </P>
      <p>Once you turn off the red switch the effect is clearly noticable as opposed to the previous attempt, all the color is gone! You look at your hands in complete black and whiteness, or do you? You think about what your metaphysical representation in this story would be, maybe too much, maybe lets say 10 minutes... 20... an hour... 6 hours...</p>
      <p>Ultimately your brain gets bored and moves on back into focus, read to perform your next action.</p>
