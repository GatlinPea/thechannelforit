       <p>A click noise would be heard now if you didnt mess up with other reality bending machinery. Once you turn it off you notice the lights are out! But... not in the expected way, ALL if the lights are out, theres no more light to see anything at all! You find yourself in an awkward void with silence, only feeling the touch of your friend trying to reach out for you in the darkness.</p>
    <br>
      <p>Suddenly you hear a loud "la pucha mattress!" or something like that, you cant really tell as the shout is in some unknown obscure language, you guess its probably french, which you think anyone would agree was pretty french sounding.
Suddenly a figure from the void appears. </p>
